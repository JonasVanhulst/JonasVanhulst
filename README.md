## 👩‍💻 About Me

🎓 I am a graduate in **Electronics-ICT** with a strong passion for **embedded systems, robotics, and automation**.  
🔭 I am currently strengthening my skills in **Python** and **C/C++**.  
🌱 I graduated from **PXL University**, specializing in **Electronics-ICT**, and I also hold a degree from **VIA** in **Electronics-Mechanics**.  
💬 Ask me anything about **embedded systems**, **robotics** and **automation** .  
📫 How to reach me: **GitHub & LinkedIn**.  
🚀 I am actively seeking opportunities in **Embedded Systems**, **Robotics Engineering**, and **Automation Engineering**.  
⚡ Fun fact: I love **cycling**.

I am especially interested in building **autonomous systems and robots that solve real-world problems**, such as self-driving and obstacle-avoiding vehicles.

During my studies, I worked on **end-to-end IoT applications**, **AI development**, and several **embedded projects**, including:
- A **self-driving obstacle-avoiding car** using **PSoC6** that also can execute commands that are send over MQTT.
- A **self-driving obstacle-avoiding car** using **PYNQ-Z2** to evaluate performance across platforms (psoc6).
- Qt Desktop Applications: Developed networked and GUI-based applications including a Connect4 game with ZeroMQ, a D&D card simulator, and an RTSP camera viewer, showcasing skills in GUI design and networking.

### 🤖 Embedded & Autonomous Systems Projects (PSoC / PYNQ / RTOS)

A collection of embedded projects developed during my studies, focusing on autonomous vehicles, FPGA-based designs, and real-time applications.  
All projects were programmed using **RTOS** and are private due to academic policies, but the concepts, architecture, and technical challenges can be discussed.

---

#### **PSoC Autonomous Car**
Developed a self-driving vehicle using a **PSoC 6**, equipped with:
- HC-R04 ultrasonic sensor
- Speed sensor (wheel encoder)
- Object detection sensors  

The vehicle autonomously navigates a course, avoiding obstacles and finding its way from point A to point B.

---

#### **PSoC 2.0**
Enhanced the autonomous car to handle **MQTT commands** from an instructor:
- Can follow instructions in real-time  
- Supports “follow-the-leader” mode upon request  

**Technical challenge:** An analysis showed the PSoC could not fully handle all MQTT tasks due to **thread limitations**, reaching its performance ceiling.

---

#### **Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 Autonomous Car**
- Designed custom **IP blocks** to interface with sensors via **Vitis Classic**  
- Programmed autonomous navigation for the vehicle, enabling it to complete routes without collisions  

**Technical highlight:** Combined FPGA design (Vivado) and embedded application development (Vitis) for real-time autonomous control.

---

### 🖥️ Qt Desktop Applications

#### **ZeroMQ Connect4 Network Game**
A networked Connect4 game built with **Qt** and **ZeroMQ**, featuring multiple microservices for scalable communication.  
- **Core functionality:** Play Connect4 against other users with a responsive GUI  
- **Architecture:** Multiple services communicate via ZeroMQ for efficiency and reliability  
- **Additional features:** API selection service, real-time user feedback, and planned message storage/logging  
- **Future expansion:** Python service to communicate with embedded devices (e.g., controlling RGB LEDs)
  
---

#### **Dungeons & Dragons Card Simulator (Qt)**
A GUI application to manage **D&D 5e cards**, allowing users to:
- Browse and select cards in an intuitive interface  
- View card details and organize custom lists  
- Future goal: implement playable mechanics to cast cards directly in-game  

**Technologies used:** Qt (C++), GUI design, ZeroMQ (for networked applications), Python (planned embedded integration)
